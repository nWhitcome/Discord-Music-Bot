# Discord Club Bot
**What is it?**
I run a Discord server with my friends called "The Covid Club" where we have weekly meetings that are similar to a book club but for music and movies.
This bot takes suggestions from users and puts up a poll using the "Simple Poll" bot. People then vote on those suggestions and one is chosen for the week.

**What are the commands?**
The bot has a few, such as:

$suggest <album name> by <artist>
  
for the music club and:
 
$suggest <movie name>

for the movie club.
The last Monday of every month is singles week for the music club, where everyone suggests a song and a playlist is created with all of the suggestions, which are done the same way.
  
Other commands that work for both are:
  
$list
  
which lists all of the current suggestions and
  
$delete
  
which deletes your own suggestion.
